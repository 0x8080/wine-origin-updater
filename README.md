Origin doesn't like to update in Wine. This Bash script automatically downloads the newest update and will install it to your installation directory using wget and unzip.

# How to use:
- Make sure Origin is closed and not running in the background
- Download this repo to any directory with write access
- Use the script by running `./updateorigin.sh` in a terminal opened in the directory
- Let the script run
- Launch Origin and enjoy
